# proyectoModeladoSistemaSoftware
In this project we will consider the creation of a domain-specific language where we will be able to create business processes ("Workflows"). First, we will generate a business process using a specific syntax (Eugenia). Subsequently, we will be able to generate the corresponding code for the automation of the created business process. For the correct functionality, our domain will encompass multiple features in the language. The final objective will be to be able to execute the generated "Workflows" in a functional way.
